1. Can't connect to Windows share; log says:

   smb_smb_negotiate: server configuration requires packet signing, which
   we dont support

   [I've seen the same problem on Linux, which makes sense, since both
   Linux and Mac OS X use Samba-based technology to connect to SMB shares.]

        Win 2003 Server SMB. June 24, 2005 -- Matthew Egan of Australia
        describes how he connects his Tiger Mac to a Windows 2003 Server
        via SMB:

            When trying to connect to a Windows 2003 Server via a Mac
            running 10.4.1 using SMB - you might get the following error
            message: "The alias [SERVERNAME] could not be opened, because
            the original item cannot be found."

            Connecting to a Macintosh share on the server works fine and
            printing to any print queues on the server works OK - it's just
            not able to connect to any shared folders via SMB.

            If you have a look at your system log you will see the
            following error message:

                Jun 22 14:42:39 PowerBook kernel[0]: smb_smb_negotiate:
                server configuration requires packet signing, which we
                don't support

                Jun 22 14:42:39 PowerBook kernel[0]: smb_smb_negotiate:
                server configuration requires packet signing, which we
                don't support

            The issue is that a Windows 2003 Server by default makes
            clients attempting to authenticate to them, use SMB packet and
            secure channel signing. Unfortunately Samba under 10.4 does not
            support this. You will need to turn off this feature on the
            Windows 2003 server. I had to restart the Windows Server for
            the digital signing setting to take affect.

            You can find a Microsoft tech article on how to change this.
