Tomcat 3.3 on Linux:

- Symlink third-party jars into $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/iaccel/WEB-INF/lib

- NOTE: You have to do something special for Oracle's thin JDBC drivers.
  Tomcat apparently won't "find" ZIP files. And, since the startup script
  ("tomcat.sh") ignores any CLASSPATH setting, you can't put Oracle's
  "classes12_01.zip" in CLASSPATH prior to firing up "tomcat.sh". To get
  Tomcat to find the Oracle JDBC drivers, symlink Oracle's "classes12_01.zip"
  file to something with a .jar extension. That seems to work fine. e.g.:

	$ cd $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/iaccel/WEB-INF/lib
	$ ln -s /path/to/classes12_01.zip oracle-jdbc.jar

- The I-Accel servlets will fail with DOM errors if xerces.jar is in the
  $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/iaccel/WEB-INF/lib directory. Tomcat is bundled with
  Crimson (see http://xml.apache.org/#crimson), which appears to be a
  compatible XML compiler. If you simply leave xerces.jar out of the
  $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/iaccel/WEB-INF/lib, everything seems to work fine.

- To save rebuilding iaccel.jar all the time, instead of putting iaccel.jar
  in $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/iaccel/WEB-INF/lib, symlink
  $FULLTILT_CLASS_ROOT/com into $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/iaccel/WEB-INF/classes

Tomcat 4.x:

- To get symlinked jars to work, use this <Context>

        <Context path="/iaccel" docBase="iaccel" debug="0" privileged="false">
        <!-- the following line permits symlinks to work -->
        <Resources className="org.apache.naming.resources.FileDirContext" allowLinking="true"/>
        </Context>


Tomcat 5.0 on FreeBSD:

- Use 1.4.2 JDK, not experiment 1.5 JDK
