   Dragging the application to the trash won't work, because there are turds
   all over the place.

3. If you want to limit an adjustment layer's effect to only one layer, you
   can do this by creating a clipping grouping. First, ensure that the
   adjustment layer is positioned immediately above the layer that it
   should affect. Hold your mouse over the border between the adjustment
   layer and the layer below it in the Layers palette. If you're using
   Photoshop CS2, press Control+Alt+G to create a clipping mask (or
   Option+Command+G on the Mac). In earlier versions of Photoshop, the
   command is Control+G (or Command+G on the Mac).

   This clipping mask limits the affect of the adjustment layer to the base
   layer in the clipping group. Because this clipping group is only two
   layers, it's the one below the adjustment layer.
