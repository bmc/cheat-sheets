# Linksys WRT52G2 Cheat Sheet

## Default password

After resetting the hardware, use `admin/admin` to log in to the management
console (via browser).

## Odd redirect when connecting to management console

Problem: Attempt to connect to management console (e.g.,
`http://firewall/`) results in a redirect to some Cisco site.

Solution: Either use the IP address, or add "basic.htm" to the end of the
URL, e.g., `http://firewall/basic.htm`
