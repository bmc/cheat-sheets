#### Getting indentation to work properly in scala.html files

* Open the _Settings_ dialog.
* Under the Project Settings, on the left, select _Template Data Languages_.
* On the right, drill down to the `views` directory, and set its template
  language to "Scala". Indentation should now mirror Scala code indentation.
