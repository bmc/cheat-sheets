- If a CD/RW won't write, try "burncd -f /dev/acd0c blank" first.
  This is especially necessary if you (stupidly) burned an audio
  CD onto the CD/RW.

- Don't use "-" in file names. They're auto-translated to "_", which is
  fine, but if you pre-generate HTML files referencing the "-" versions
  (e.g., genindex), the HTML will references files that don't exist on the
  CD.

- If VMWare is running, it'll hold the CD device open, preventing burncd(8)
  from grabbing it. Disconnect it (via the VMWare "Devices" menu) to fix
  the problem.
