- It's possible to expose addresses behind the router. To do so, enable
  the firewall feature. Then, go to

	Firewall > DMZ

  and add NAT mappings that map external addresses to internal ones.

- By default, pings are disabled. To enable, from admin screen, go to

  	Firewall > Intrusion Detection

  and disable "Discard Ping from WAN"
