2.  When you attempt to open the Add or Remove Programs applet in the
    Control Panel, the following message may appear:

        Add or Remove Programs has been restricted.
        Please check with your administrator.

    This is due to one of the following Policy settings:

    - NoAddRemovePrograms

    have disabled the Add or Remove Programs applet. For standalone
    systems, follow the steps below to unlock the restrictions.

    - Navigate to the following branches one by one:

      HKEY_CURRENT_USER \ Software \ Microsoft \ Windows \ CurrentVersion \ Policies \ Uninstall

    - Delete the NoAddRemovePrograms value if present in the above locations.

    - Then, navigate to following locations:
