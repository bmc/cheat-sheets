FreeBSD now ships with OpenSSH. wildbean and condor are running
OpenSSH. OpenSSH client can connect to traditional SSH 2 server, but it's
a little trickier to connect from a traditional SSH 2 client to an
OpenSSH server. To do that:

1. Take the PGP-like public key generated by the traditional SSH 2 client.
2. Extract the key itself.
3. Join all the lines into one long line.
4. Add that one long line to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on the target
   machine, as so:

	ssh-dss <key-bytes> <user>@<host>
