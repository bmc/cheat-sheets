                             NetBeans 5.5

1. To add an update center to the list of update centers:

   - Select Tools>Options menu item
   - Select "Advanced Options"
   - Drill down to System>Autoupdate Types
   - Right-click and select New>General Update Center
   - Enter the update center name and click "Finish"
   - In options dialog expand the Autoupdate Types node, select the update
     center you just created
   - On the right hand side enter the update center url.


2. Getting NetBeans 5.5 to run XMLC in JDK 1.4.

   a. Install the Freeform Project Extras module from nbextras

   b. Select the JDK in the project.

   c. Edit nbproject/jdk.xml, target "-jdk-preset-basic", to have
      this entry:

        <runxmlc-presetdef javaval="${nbjdk.java}"/>
        <macrodef name="javadoc-presetdef">
            <attribute name="javadocval"/>
            <sequential>
                <presetdef name="javadoc">
                    <javadoc executable="@{javadocval}"/>
                </presetdef>
            </sequential>
        </macrodef>

   d. Now, <runxmlc> should work fine, but you'll get this compile error:

         .../pps/src/com/fulltiltinc/b2b/coreservlet/html/SimulateIdleTransaction_en.java:170: cannot access org.w3c.dom.ranges.DocumentRange
         file org/w3c/dom/ranges/DocumentRange.class not found
                     setDocument(fLazyDocument, "text/html", "ISO-8859-1");

      That's because the XML APIs in the native JDK don't have the required
      classes. Add this line to the ${pps}/build.xml file's
      "compile.classpath" entry:

          <pathelement location="${ext.lib.dir}/xerces-2.7.1/xml-apis.jar"/>

   e. Still seems to use the 1.5 Swing HTML parser, though. Hmm.

3. Compilation failing on code that pulls in XML APIs:

   - Try copying the appropriate third-party jars (e.g., xercesImpl.jar
     and xml-apis.jar) to $NBHOME/ide7/ant/lib

4. Sometimes, NB 5.5 remembers a breakpoint, even though it doesn't show a
   little box for it next to the line of code. Since the box isn't there,
   it can be difficult to delete the remembered breakpoint. Solution: Delete
   it from the "breakpoints" window:

   Window > Debugging > Breakpoints will show all the breakpoints of active
   project. They can be killed from there.
