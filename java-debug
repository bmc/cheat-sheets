First, you need to run the servlet under JDK 1.3.

There are only two changes I made to my jserv config files to get the
debugger to connect to jserv.  The first is in jserv.properties:

wrapper.bin.parameters=-classic -Xdebug -Xnoagent
    -Djava.compiler=none
    -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,address=8000,server=y,suspend=n

Of course all this should be on one line but this stupid emailer won't let
me do that.  These flags tell the jvm to use the classic engine (not
hotspot) and set things up so that the debugger can connect via sockets on
port 8000 to the jvm.  Note that Forte might be running anywhere!

And then in jserv.conf I raised the VM timeout parameter so that things
don't just stop on you while you sit in the debugger pondering something (if
you have suspended all threads):

ApJservVMTimeout    9999

And then you can connect using the menu commands "Debug -> Attach to VM".
Specify the name of the machine that the servlet is running on and the port
given in the address= argument and you should see, amazingly, the debugger
hook up to the servlet.
