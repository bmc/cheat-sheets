How I get IE 5.5 to run
by anonymous coward on Sunday November 24th 2002, 23:48
Installed the wine that came with my distro(wine-20020605-2 on Redhat 8.0).

Ran wine to create default .wine directory and configuration files.

Made directory wine-c in the .wine directory.

Edited .wine/config and changed the [Drive C] path to
"/home/home_directory/.wine/wine-c" with home_directory being appropriately
set.

Copied a complete Win98SE installation with drivers(latest Nvidia, SB Live
value, LNE100TX), IE5.5SP2, all necessary patches, and Quicktime to
.wine/wine-c directory.

Made all of the files in the .wine/wine-c directory lower case(this appears
to be important--IE wouldn't work until I did it).

Ran: wine /home/home_directory/.wine/wine-c/program\ files/internet\
explorer/iexplore.exe

There have been some quirks and crashes, here and there, but it seems
operational.
