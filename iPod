 1. Using Apple iPod with Linux.

    First, see:

    http://www.freedos.org/jhall/ipod/
    http://pag.csail.mit.edu/~adonovan/hacks/ipod.html

    a) Getting iPod to mount properly, and with the right permissions.

       Install iPod.fdi (in this directory) in /usr/share/hal/fd/95userpolicy
       See http://www.kgarner.com/blog/archives/2005/01/11/fc3-hal-ipod/

    b) Accessing iPod:

       Use gtkpod. Note, however, that the version that ships with FC3
       does not have support for MP4 files. To get that support, do the
       following. (See http://www.freedos.org/jhall/ipod/ for more details.)

       - Download source for libid3tag from
         http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=12349

         Configure, build, install:

             ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
             make
             make install
         
       - Download source to mpeg4ip1.2 from
         http://mpeg4ip.sourceforge.net/

         Configure, build, install:

             ./bootstrap --prefix=/usr/local --disable-server
             make
             make install

       - Download source to gtkpod from http://gtkpod.sourceforge/net

         Configure, build, install:

             CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include \
                     -L/usr/local/lib \
             ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
             make 
             make install 

      - Use a front-end script for gtkpod that sets the appropriate
        LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g.,:

        exec env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/gtkpod


   c) Even with the instructions in (a), the iPod still doesn't want to
      disconnect properly. Quick hack solution:

      - Disable automount option in gtkpod.

      - Create a "umount-ipod" script:

            sudo umount /media/iPod
	    exec sudo eject -s /dev/sda2

      - Create a "mount-ipod" script (for consistency):

	    mount /media/iPod

      - Modify gtkpod front end so it looks like this:

	    mount-ipod
	    env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib /usr/local/bin/gtkpod
	    umount-ipod
