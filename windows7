   (Vista instructions, but works with Win 7.)

2. Updating Windows 7's print drivers (i.e., adding more Microsoft drivers):

   - Start > Devices and Printers
   - Select a printer
   - When "Print server properties" appears up top, click on it.
   - In the resulting pop-up window, select the Drivers tab.
   - Click the "Add..." button.
   - Click Next until you get to the Printer Driver Selection window.
   - Click Windows Update.
   - Wait a surprisingly long time.
   - When the dialog returns, find the manufacturer and print driver for
     the printer. Select it and hit "Next".
   - On the final screen, click "Finish". This might take awhile to complete.

   The driver should now be available when adding a printer.

3. Getting Windows 7 to talk to a CUPS printer on another system.

   See #16 in the "Ubuntu" cheat sheet.
