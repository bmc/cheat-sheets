1. To get KDE to source environment or run commands on startup, put
   files ending in .sh in $HOME/.kde/env

   Known to work on Fedora Core 3. May not work on older installations
   (e.g., FreeBSD 4.x)

2. If icons don't stay where they're put, make sure that
   $HOME/Desktop/.directory is writable. That's where the positions are
   stored.

3. Koffice MIME type problems:

        Subject: Kivio won't start?
        by Haakon Nilsen on Wednesday May 23, @08:47PM

        When starting the kivio that came with the mandrake rpm's, i get
        this (console) message:  koffice (lib kofficecore): ERROR: Couldn't
        find the native MimeType in kivio's desktop file. Check your
        installation !
        ...and it doesn't start. what can i do?

        Subject: try kbuildsycoca
        by John Dailey on Friday May 25, @02:57AM

        I had this problem once...someone eventually suggested I run the
        program "kbuildsycoca".  It worked.  I have no idea if that will
        help (that was on KDE 2.0), and I'm not real clear on what that
        program does but you can try it.  Just run it as root.  I think it
        does something with a database of mime types.  Maybe someone who
        knows what they're talking about can clarify.  :-)

   Seems to fix the problem.

4. If you log in, and xlogin (Eterm or aterm, even) doesn't work, try
   firing up an xterm; then, try xlogin/Eterm again.

5. To get rid of this problem:

	$ uptime
	uptime: /dev/:0: No such file or directory
	8:51AM  up 14 days, 21:21, 11 users, load averages: 0.08, 0.06, 0.02

   edit /usr/local/share/config/kdm/{Xreset,Xstartup} and change
   "-l $DISPLAY" to "-l console"

6. Dcopserver complaints:

	- remove ~/.ICE* ~/.DCOP*
	- dcopserver

7. Error on startup:

        klauncher said: Unknown procotol 'file'

   Look for /var/tmp/kdecache-$USER, and kill it.

8. Connecting Samba shares: Use knetattach
