<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>This repo contains a bunch of cheat sheets in Markdown format. The cheat
sheets are maintained as <a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/syntax.html">Markdown</a> documents, as supported by the Ruby
<a href="http://kramdown.rubyforge.org/">Kramdown</a> gem. The documents are converted to HTML via <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">Rake</a>; for
convenience, the resulting HTML is also maintained in the repo.</p>

<h2 id="building-andor-reading">Building and/or reading</h2>

<p>Ensure that you have RubyGems installed, as well as the <code>kramdown</code> gem.
Then, simply issue <code>rake</code> to build/rebuild the HTML versions of the cheat
sheets.</p>

<p>Or, just read the Markdown source files.</p>

<h2 id="no-warranty">NO WARRANTY</h2>

<p>I <strong>do not</strong> guarantee the accuracy of the information in these documents.
Specifically:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The instructions in a document are generally correct, at that time I add
them. But there&rsquo;s no guarantee that a particular cheat sheet hasn&rsquo;t suffered
<a href="http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/bitrot.html">bit rot</a> and aged to irrelevance.</li>
  <li>Each instruction represents <em>one way</em> I discovered to solve a problem.
There may be other ways, including <em>better</em> ways, to solve any particular
issue.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you follow my cheat sheets blindly, and terrible things happen to your
computer as a result, <strong>it&rsquo;s not my fault</strong>. I wrote these cheat sheets for
my own use. I maintain them here largely for convenience. If they&rsquo;re useful
to you, great, but the onus is on <em>you</em> to use them with care.</p>
