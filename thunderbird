1. To get Thunderbird to use Firefox as its browser, add these lines
   to $HOME/.thunderbird/*.default/user.js:

// Use firefox for http, https & ftp links
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.http", "/home/bmc/bin/browser-remote");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.https", "/home/bmc/bin/browser-remote");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.ftp", "/home/bmc/bin/browser-remote");

2. Thunderbird quotes messages with a revision bar. The "quote colors"
   extension (http://quotecolors.mozdev.org/download.html) allows greater
   control over the configuration, and makes it simple to revert to using
   a ">" instead.

3. "Script busy or not responding"

   http://kb.mozillazine.org/Script_busy_or_stopped_responding

      If you get a "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have
      stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue
      to see if the script will complete" error message that typically
      means that some javascript didn't execute within the time specified
      by dom.max_script_run_time. This might occur when sending a message
      using a mailing list or when fetching new mail using the webmail
      extension.

      The dom.max_script_run_time preference defaults to 5 seconds in
      Thunderbird 1.5. Try increasing it to 30 seconds using Edit ->
      Preferences -> Advanced -> General -> Config editor.

4. Getting Thunderbird to pick up changes to folders that are created by
   an external program such as procmail.

   Assumptions: Thunderbird & procmail (and programs it invokes) are
   running on the same machine.

   This problem requires an IMAP server. Current solution (which also
   attempts to retain compatibility with other mailers, e.g., Emacs VM):

   a) Install uw-imap daemon and enable it.

   b) Move ~/Mail directory (with saved folders) to something else, e.g.,
      ~/mail-folders.

   c) Change ~/.vm to point to ~/mail-folders, instead of ~/Mail

   d) Create a ~/thunderbird directory, and two subdirectories:

      ~/thunderbird/imap-local      local directory for caching IMAP folder
				    data
      ~/thunderbird/local-folders   local Thunderbird folders

   e) In Thunderbird, set the Local Folders account to point to
      ~/thunderbird/local-folders

   f) Create a new account in Thunderbird, pointing to the local IMAP server.

   g) Make sure ~/.procmail/rc creates its files in ~/Mail, which is where
      the IMAP server will look for folders other than the default.

      **** NOTE: This requires a modified uw-imap! Get the source or
      **** source RPM, and read the docs/CONFIG file. (See Example 2).
      **** See uw-imap cheat sheet.

   h) In Thunderbird, subscribe (File > Subscribe) to the procmail folders

   That should be it.

5. Adjusting fonts in the entire program:

   Add this entry to userChrome.css (in
   ~/.thunderbird/whatever.default/chrome/userChrome.css):

       * {
       font-size: 20pt !important
       }

6. Multiple SMTP servers:

   To add an additional SMTP server:

   * Go to "Tools -> Account Settings".
   * At the bottom of the left pane (you may need to scroll down), click on
     "Outgoing Server (SMTP)".
   * Click the "Add" button.
   * Insert the SMTP server information that you want, and click the "OK"
     button.

   To use this newly added SMTP server for any of your mail accounts:

   * Go to "Tools -> Account Settings", and then in the left pane click on
     the account name whose SMTP server you want to change.
   * At the bottom of the "Default identity" panel, choose the SMTP server
     you want to use from the "Outgoing Server (SMTP)" pulldown list.

7. Thunderbird insists on sending HTML (e.g., on a reply to an HTML message),
   even though the Compose HTML general setting is off, and even though HTML
   is disabled for the recipient.

   Solution: Check the HTML setting associated with the identity (in Manage
   Identities).
