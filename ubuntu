 1. Getting sound to work.

    Specific to the Intel ICH8 (in many laptops):

    Also, make sure the sound isn't (accidentally) muted.

 2. Getting Broadcom wireless NIC to work. (This is the NIC in Dell laptops.)

    (Be sure the Wifi switch on the side of the laptop is on!)

 3. Changing size of Gnome terminal. From
    http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=15471

    The gnome-terminal uses a termcap file for its basic settings. To change
    these, edit /usr/share/vte/termcap/xterm

    Change the "li#24" entry to some other size. Save the file, and the next
    spawned Gnome terminal will take that size.

    Doesn't always work. If not, use --geometry=80x44 (or whatever)

 4. Set keybindings for GTK applications:

    gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/interface/gtk_key_theme Emacs --type string

 5. Getting Adobe Acrobat Reader (and other proprietary stuff) for Ubuntu
    http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-adobe-pdf-reader-811-with-plug-in-for-mozilla-firefox-in-gutsy-gibbon.html

 6. Rough equivalent to "chkconfig" is "update-rc.d"

 7. Install Sun JDK 6. From
    http://broersa.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/install-sun-jdk-6-on-ubuntu-gutsy/

    sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk sun-java6-plugin sun-java6-fonts
    sudo update-java-alternatives --set java-6-sun

 8. Mounting remote Windows or Samba shares.
    - apt-get install smbfs
    - Then, add something like this to /etc/fstab
      //tera1/share /mnt/tera1 cifs username=root,password=,noauto,uid=0,rw,suid 0 0

 9. When removing a package, you get 'subprocess pre-removal script returned
    error', and the package refuses to go away. Solution:

    - Go to /var/lib/dpkg/info
    - Look for package.prerm
    - Remove it
    - Try again

10. Getting Gnome desktop to quit prompting for trash emptying:

    - Fire up gconf-editor from the command line
    - Go to apps/nautilus/preferences and uncheck confirm_trash

11. Show the Computer, Home and Trash desktop icons in Gnome.
    From https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/ch12s07.html

    - Run gconf-editor
    - Choose: apps > nautilus > desktop
    - Enable/disable whatever. Changes take place immediately.

12. Playing WMV files, and other proprietary stuff:
