1. To get Gnome to run a startup script before invoking gnome-session (e.g.,
   to ensure that various environment variables are set):

   On Linux, do one of:

   a) Modify /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/Gnome so that the appropriate file
      is sourced before gnome-session is exec'd. For instance, have
      it check for the existence of "$HOME/.gnome/init.sh".

   b) Specify that an "xsession" style session is to be created, and have
      .xsession fire up "gnome-session" exactly as in
      /etc/X11/gdm/Sessions/Gnome.
      Then, be sure all the settings are in .xsession. Setting LC_ALL=C helps.


   Nautilus sometimes refuses to come back up if you log out and log back in.
   To get it to work again,

   a) Remove the $HOME/.nautilus directory
   b) Run /usr/bin/nautilus-clean.sh
   c) Kill and gconfd-1 process that's running
   d) Log out and log back in.
   e) Type "nautilus" in a command window.

   The Nautilus configurator should come up.

2. Disable cursor blinking in gnome-terminal:

   $ gnome-keyboard-properties

   Fix it there. Takes effect immediaely.
