Linux on Toshiba Laptop
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Touchpad: From http://plaza.ufl.edu/redboots/#touchpad

	Touchpad setup

	Initially the touchpad didn't work and I had to rely on a USB
	mouse. To correct this in a crude manner the following steps were
	taken:

	1. First, during the Toshiba display at the beginning of booting,
	   press the F2 key. This will bring you to the bios setup.
	2. Next, press the right arrow key to select the Advanced mode.
           Press the down arrow button to select the Legacy USB Support
           option. Press F5 to disable it.
	3. Press ESC and save your settings.
	4. Reboot the computer.  Touchpad should now work.

Touchpad does work, but is slow.


Sudden crash of Toshiba laptop when running Linux

    pmw: I have a dual boot FC2/XP Home Toshiba A60 laptop which will
    suddenly crash without warning when I'm using FC2 (never with
    Windows). I've tried a number of different kernels, and have had
    the same problem... and my installation is completely up-to-date
    according to up2date. When I say "crash", I mean complete power
    off, immediately... no hanging, no warning, nothing. The only thing
    I can think of is that there is a major ACPI problem... I'm plugged
    into the mains supply most of the time, but still get the crashes -
    so it's not a flat battery. Does anyone else have this problem, or
    have any idea how to go about solving it? I'm sure it's nothing I'm
    doing which causes the problem, as it seems to happen just
    randomly. When I reboot after such a crash, the ventilation fan
    runs constantly and furiously for a looooong time (don't know if
    this is standard, or not).

    The problem happens with: 2.6.9-1.3_FC2, 2.6.8-1.521, 2.6.5-1.358,
    in my experience. In other words, all the kernels I've had!

    Kwast & Co: put echo "force_on:1" > proc/acpi/fan/FAN1/state in
    rc.local to turn the fan on if you don't want a sudden shut down
    due to overheating.

    pmw: Coo, thanks Dick. I hope that works. Is there any more
    user-friendly way to adjust ACPI settings? A nice GUI, or
    something? Having a look at /proc/acpi makes me wonder what I can
    do with the rest of the behind-the-scenes hardware settings.

    pmw: No matter, just found klaptop_acpi_helper ... I guess that's
    the best I'm going to get, huh?

    Kwast & Co: Don't worry, it will work, without it the fan will not
    turn on and your Toshiba will shut down if the cpu gets too hot. As
    a second security I also let the cpu frequency downscale to 1400
    MHz when it reaches a temperature of 65 C , using p4-clockmod and
    CPUspeed:

    put echo "1399965" > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq

    in your rc.local to set the lowest frequency at 1400MHz.

    In your cpuspeed.conf:

    VMAJOR=1
    VMINOR=1
    OPTS="-i 1"
    DRIVER="p4-clockmod"
    OPTS="-p 90 100 -t /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THZN/temperature 64"

    Now it runs always full speed unless the cpu temperature reaches 65
    degrees Celcius, in that case it slows down en speed up again if
    the temperature lowers below 64 degrees C.

    (Never see this by the way, it's just extra safety to protect the
    cpu when it gots stuck at 100% cpu load)

    Don't know about klaptop_acpi_helper ......

    pmw: Well, I'm as surprised as you, Dick, but my laptop crashed
    again, even with the suggestions you made (I keep checking
    periodically that the fan is set to on, and it is.) Very strange.

    Kwast & Co: What BIOS version are you running on you A60?

    The latest version (1.80) solved some temperature and Fan issues.
 
    pmw: Yep, 1.80. I also noticed that my screen doesn't turn off when
    I close the lid of the laptop. I really hope the people at Fedora
    are going to make this ACPI stuff a lot easier! pmw: Hmm, I updated
    the BIOS via my Windows installation... I am assuming that the BIOS
    is independent of operating system, and that this wouldn't be the
    cause of my Fedora problems? 

    bednar: hi, same problem using SuSe 9.1 and 9.2 on Toshiba Satellite
    1135-S1554 with bios 1.7. In windows everythink is ok. The problem
    shows only when battery powered and could be solved by starting
    system with acpi=off added to kernel options.

    raffi: Hello, I have similar problem with my hp pavilion zt1170,
    running slackware 10.0, 2.4 kernel. The system crashes without any
    obvious reason. It mostly happens when the cpu is heavy used, for
    instance during kernel compilation (yep, I have to get off-powered
    to compile it!). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I suppose that acpi
    only works if batteries are *not* powered, yes? But putting
    acpi=off during boot time makes no difference, it still crashes. I
    also can't find anything about fans in the /proc structure... Maybe
    I should recompile the kernel without acpi at all? Oh, and, the
    worst of all, it used to work on windows...

    mitchellj: ACPI Works both when powered via AC/DC and when using
    batteried. It is a power management feature.

    The best thing to do is compile the kernel WITH ACPI enabled, then
    you can just force the fan on and it will cool down for you. The
    reason the Tosh crashes is due to overheating, its not really a
    crash as such its a safety shut off. The reason it worked in
    windows is that the Tosh has ACPI drivers which are fully
    compatible with windows, but like most companies, they decided not
    to develop linux drivers as it costs them money! But the funny
    thing is they won't even release the details of the bios ACPI so
    linux kernel developers can do it for free.
