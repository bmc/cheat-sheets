The default GTK2 keybindings are supposed to be more user-friendly (Ctl+A maps
to "select all") but this user likes Emacs keybindings (though I prefer VIM).

Add this to your ~/.gtkrc-2.0:

	gtk-key-theme-name = "Emacs"

Additionally, to map Ctl+U to the way it works in readline programs add this:

	binding "my-text-entry" {
  	    bind "<ctrl>u" { "delete-from-cursor" (paragraphs, -1) }
	}
	class "GtkEntry" binding "my-text-entry"

Dave Ahlswede saw this and asked how to accomplish the same effect on a
GtkTextView. After looking through the code it looks like there's a bit that
was left unimpelemented, but it seems that this will accomplish the same
effect:

	binding "my-text-view" {
	    bind "u" { "delete-from-cursor" (paragraphs, 1) }
	}
	class "GtkTextView" binding "my-text-view"

Note the positive one.

And finally, Colin Marquardt (<c.marquardt@alcatel.de>) submitted another tip.
By adding

	gtk-can-change-accels = 1

you can change the keybindings in menus by hitting the hotkey you want to map
the menu to while the mouse is over the menu item.
