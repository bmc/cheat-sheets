Linux tools for interacting with Dell machines (including BIOS upgrades):

NOTE: On CentOS/RHEL, if installing via "yum" doesn't work, use "up2date".


Downloading firmware: See http://fwupdate.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page

	# yum install $(inventory_firmware -b)
	# yum apply_changes --yes

Might have to run apply_changes more than once. It stages the firmware
upgrade;rebooting causes the BIOS to update.
