1. To boot without the graphics (i.e., in normal Linux text mode), disable
   Aurora. That can be done by moving "/etc/aurora/Monitor" to
   "/etc/aurora/Monitor-". /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit looks for the presence of
   that file (among other things).

2. To prevent editing of /etc/resolv.conf when link comes up, modify
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-{link} (e.g., ifcfg-eth0) and
   add this line:

   RESOLV_MODS=no
