1. Firefox crashes when attempting to print.

   Problem has to do with libcups.so being linked against OpenSSL. There's
   a FreeBSD thread on that very issue here:

   http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-questions/2004-December/067139.html

   Solution: Rebuild libcups (/usr/ports/print/cups-base), but add these
   lines to its Makefile first:

	CONFIGURE_ARGS+= --disable-openssl --enable-gnutls

   Then, restart Firefox. All should be well.

2. "Script busy or not responding"

   Adapted from http://kb.mozillazine.org/Script_busy_or_stopped_responding

      If you get a "A script on this page may be busy, or it may have
      stopped responding. You can stop the script now, or you can continue
      to see if the script will complete" error message that typically
      means that some javascript didn't execute within the time specified
      by dom.max_script_run_time. This might occur when sending a message
      using a mailing list or when fetching new mail using the webmail
      extension.

      The dom.max_script_run_time preference defaults to 5 seconds in
      Thunderbird 1.5 and in Firefox. Try increasing it to 30 seconds
      "about:config"

3. Getting rid of IntelliTXT ads (embedded context-sensitive ads that
   create double-underlined green hyperlinks in the content, which,
   when moused over, create an advertisement popup):

   Programmer Brian Donovan has written a Greasemonkey script called Uh Oh
   IntelliTXT [http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/4250] to block IntelliTXT
   popups for Firefox users. IntelliTXT can also be deactivated with the
   Adblock plus Firefox extension by using the string *Intellitxt* in your
   filter list.
