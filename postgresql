1. Ubuntu (and maybe other Unices): Initial user is "postgres". Authentication
   is defined in "pg_hba.conf" (/etc/postgres/<version>), defaults to
   "ident". You can't fire up "psql" without proper auth.

   - Leave configuration alone.
   - "su" to the "postgres" user
   - "psql" should then work

2. Get list of databases:

   select datname from pg_database

3. Give a user (role) superuser privilege:

   ALTER ROLE username WITH superuser

4. Load a CSV file (or some other kind of file) into PostgreSQL:

   COPY tablename FROM 'file.csv' CSV;

   See http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/sql-copy.html
