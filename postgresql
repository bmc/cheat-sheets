1. Ubuntu (and maybe other Unices): Initial user is "postgres". Authentication
   is defined in "pg_hba.conf" (/etc/postgres/<version>), defaults to
   "ident". You can't fire up "psql" without proper auth.

   - Leave configuration alone.
   - "su" to the "postgres" user
   - "psql" should then work

2. Get list of databases:

   select datname from pg_database
