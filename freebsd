Creating a Swapfile on FreeBSD 4.X

    - Be certain that your kernel configuration includes the vnode driver.
      It is not in recent versions of GENERIC.

            pseudo-device   vn 1   #Vnode driver (turns a file into a device)

    - Create a vn-device:

          # cd /dev
          # sh MAKEDEV vn0

    - Create a swapfile (/usr/swap0):

          # dd if=/dev/zero of=/usr/swap0 bs=1024k count=64

    - Set proper permissions on (/usr/swap0):

          # chmod 0600 /usr/swap0

    - Enable the swap file in /etc/rc.conf:

          swapfile="/usr/swap0"

    - Reboot the machine or to enable the swap file immediately, type:

          # vnconfig -e /dev/vn0b /usr/swap0 swap

    See http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/adding-swap-space.html

			CDs, CD-RWs, and ISO Images
			---------------------------

Mounting an ISO image from a file:

    This is how to mount an ISO image. If you have just created an
    ISO image, say with mkisofs, there is a way to mount the image
    and view it without creating a CD ROM. Let's assume you have
    an ISO image named image.iso and it resides in the current
    directory.

	# vnconfig /dev/vn0c ./image.iso
	# mount -t cd9660 /dev/vn0c /cdrom

    When you're finished with the image, here's how you reverse the above:

	# umount /cdrom
	# vnconfig -u /dev/vn0c

    (See http://www.freebsddiary.org/iso-mount.php)

burncd(8):

    With Plextor, use -m option. e.g.:

	sudo burncd -f /dev/acd0c -s 4 -m -e data isofile fixate


Raw copy of a CD via dd(1):

	sudo dd if=/dev/acd0c of=out.iso bs=2048

    Omitting "bs=2048", or using the wrong block size, will lead to the
    error "dd: /dev/acd0c: Invalid argument"

			   General Ports Issues
			   --------------------

Korn shell can screw up certain "ports" makes. If that happens, use this
when building a port:

	ENV= SHELL=/usr/local/bin/bash make 


Encounter following error:

	Undefined subroutine &Autom4te::move called at /usr/local/bin/autom4te line 628.

Problem appears to be an incompatibility between autoconf and p5-File-Tools.
Remove the p5-File-Tools package, and the problem goes away. See the message
to "freebsd-stable" in the "autom4te.mail" file in this directory.

			      Java on FreeBSD
			      ---------------

When building native FreeBSD Java port:

- Unset all JAVA env variables, esp. JAVA_HOME
- Unset PLATFORM; it's used by the makefiles.

Installing Win98: Put a DOS-formatted floppy (with anything on it) in the
    floppy drive, or Windows Setup will hang trying to read the drive.

X Server may need to have DGA enabled to support full-screen mode.


		       ----------------------------
		       Building a "Release" Version
		       ----------------------------

- cvs update and a "make release', or
- cvs update and "make -DMAKE_ISOS release" (to get ISO images)n
