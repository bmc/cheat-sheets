Editing out pixel hot spots

http://www.basic-digital-photography.com/how-to-take-night-photos.html

One problem with digital cameras is that there are always some pixels on
the image sensor which are bad. When taking day photos, these defects are
not discernible. However, they are pretty obvious in night photos. How
do we correct these? Here?s a simple way ? take a control shot, then
use image editing to subtract out those bad pixels.

This is how it works. The next time you?re out to take night photos,
go ahead and snap a picture of Scene A, as you normally would. Then,
when it?s convenient, take a photo of the exact same Scene A again,
but with the lens cap on.

Now you will have two images, one night shot and one control shot
(with the hot pixels). Load them up in say, Paint Shop Pro. Switch to
the control shot and select Edit and Copy from the menu. Next, switch
to the night shot and paste the copied image as a new layer. Then,
select the new layer and change the Blend Mode to Difference and click
OK. You?ll get the correct night shot with the hot spots subtracted out.

BTW, for those who care, this is FreeBSD 4.7-RELEASE.

Also, I can get the camera to auto-mount by judicious use of
/etc/usbd.conf. Here are the steps I took:

0. Make sure all usb devices are created. (They weren't, and on my desktop
   system, the convenient USB port, on the front, is /dev/usb2.)

1. Kill the running usbd daemon.

2. Fire it up in foreground, as root: usbd -d -v -v -v

3. Plug the camera in. Watch usbd's debug output to see what the vendor,
   product, and release codes are.

4. For convenience, add an entry in /etc/fstab:

        /dev/da0s1   /mnt/camera   msdos   ro,noauto   0   0

5. Create an appropriate section in /etc/usbd.conf

        # Sony Digital Camera (bmc@clapper.org)
        device "Digital Camera"
                vendor 0x054c
                product 0x0010
                release 0x0450
                attach "sleep 2; /sbin/mount /mnt/camera"
                detach "/sbin/umount /mnt/camera"

   The "sleep" is necessary to allow time for the driver to detect the
   device and bring it fully online. Without the "sleep", the mount(8) call
   fails.

With those steps done, I can access the camera's memory stick simply by
plugging the camera into the USB port on my FreeBSD workstation. The
contents of the memory stick show up under /mnt/camera. When I turn the
camera off or unplug the cable, the file system is automatically unmounted.

Cool++

Q. How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb?
A. None.  It's a hardware problem.
