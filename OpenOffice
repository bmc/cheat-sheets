Building 1.1, even from the port:
---------------------------------

- Be sure to unset PLATFORM environment variable.

- Move "jikes" to "jikes-" temporarily, while configure phase runs. Or
  make sure JIKESPATH is unset, so JIKES uses the CLASSPATH, instead.
  (Safer just to make sure "configure" doesn't use jikes.)

- Suggested port "make" variable settings:

	WITH_TTF_BYTECODE_ENABLED=YES
