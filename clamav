1. Building clamav on FreeBSD 4.x (clamav versions >= 0.90)

   a) Won't configure, due to -lpthread in configure. So, from the
      port (/usr/ports/security/clamav), do:

      - Make extract

      Then, edit the "configure" script, looking for the -lpthread
      specified on the probe for libmilter. Change it to -lpthread.

      Re-run "make configure"

   b) Once configured, it won't build for the same reasons. So, create
      a "ged" script that looks like this:

          /-lpthread/
          /-pthread/

      Then, from /usr/ports/security/clamav/work/clamav-0.90, run this
      command:

         ged /tmp/ged $(find . -name Makefile | xargs grep -l -- -lpthread)

   c) Now, run a "make" from the top of the port. It should build.
