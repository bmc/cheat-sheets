 1. Focus follows mouse: Support is limited currently. But, courtesy of
    http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20031029203936659

    A feature that I've long waited for -- window focus that follows the
    mouse between terminal windows -- has finally been added (in a hidden
    manner) to the 10.3 Terminal application. From the Terminal, type:

        defaults write com.apple.Terminal FocusFollowsMouse -string YES

    Quit and restart the Terminal and enjoy! Now if I only had window
    autoraise, I'd be in heaven!

 2. Emacs options:

    a) Aquamacs Emacs: Completely re-worked, Carbon-ized, Mac-specific
       version of GNU Emacs.

    b) Emacs as installed via Darwin Ports ("port"). Seems to have problems
       creating a mapping from Command (or Option) to the Meta key.

    c) Regular GNU Emacs. See 

       http://members.shaw.ca/akochoi-emacs/stories/obtaining-and-building.html

       Solution:

       - Build first for NextStep:

         $ ./configure --with-ns --without-dbus
         $ make bootstrap
         $ make
         $ sudo make install

       - Next, build for X:

         $ make clean
         $ ./configure --with-x
         $ make bootstrap
         $ make
         $ sudo cp src/emacs /usr/local/bin/emacs-x

       - Then, use a modified version of the "e" front-end shell script
         to fire up the appropriate one, depending on whether login is
         local or remote.

       Note: --with-ns creates a Mac Emacs.app folder, which ends
       up being installed in /Applications, allowing use directly from the
       desktop.

 3. Thunderbird: If it hangs, try removing all the ".msf" folders in the
    local folders area, letting T-bird rebuild them (especially if they
    were built by T-bird running on another OS).

 4. Creating a login hook:

    http://www.bombich.com/mactips/loginhooks.html
    http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301446

    One solution:

    a) Create directory /Library/Local
    b) Create file /Library/Local/on-login.sh containing, e.g.:

          #!/bin/sh

          case "$#" in
              0)
                  echo "No user specified!" >&2
 		 exit 1
 		 ;;
          esac

          if [ -f /Users/$1/.on-login.sh ]
          then
              su $1 -c "/Users/$1/.on-login.sh"
          fi

    c) Use individual .on-login.sh scripts in user directories.

 5. Automounting shares and NFS partitions:

    http://www.bombich.com/mactips/automount.html
    http://mactechnotes.blogspot.com/2005/08/mac-os-x-as-nfs-client_31.html

 6. Having Windows shares mount themselves automatically on login:

    http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070202190047133

 7. Restarting postfix (works for other servers, too):

    $ sudo launchctl stop org.postfix.master
    $ sudo launchctl start org.postfix.master

 8. Bring up a PPTP VPN and, by default, all traffic gets routed over that
    connection. Solution:

    - Pull up Internet Connect.
    - Select the PPTP VPN.
    - Go to the menu bar and select Connect>Options
    - Uncheck "Send all traffic over VPN connection"

 9. Locking the screen without logging off:

    http://www.macworld.com/weblogs/macosxhints/2006/01/lockscreen/index.php

       You can use this application (in your Applications/Utilities folder)
       to quickly activate your screen saver from the menubar and require a
       password to turn it off--even if the Security pane option isn't
       enabled. Open Keychain Access and then go to Keychain Access:
       Preferences. Click on the General tab and select the Show Status in
       Menu Bar option. A small lock icon will appear in your menu bar.
       Close the Preferences window and quit Keychain Access. Now click the
       lock icon in your menubar and choose Lock Screen to start your screen
       saver.

    Another solution: The LockTight preference pane, which allows setting
    a hot key combination for the "lock screen" capability.

    http://mac.pieters.cx/

    In Snow Leopard, Ctrl-Shift-Eject activates the screen saver.

10. Burning a DVD from a disk image (.img file) created by (e.g.) iDVD:

    - Mount the image (double click on it).
    - Start the Disk Utility (Applications/Disk Utility).
    - Select the mounted image.
    - The Burn button in the upper left of the Disk Utility will activate.
    - Put a DVD (R, R/W) in the drive.
    - Click the Burn button.

11. Burning a DVD or CD from an ISO image:

    - Locate the .iso file in a Finder window
    - Single click it
    - File > Open With > Disk Utility
    - Select the .iso file in the Disk Utility window
    - Images > Burn

12. Calibrating the monitor: Use System Preferences > Displays > Calibrate
    Select Expert Mode.

13. Mac Fuse notes

    http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/HOWTO

    - When building, use "port" to install pkg-config, glib-2.0,
      glib2-devel

    sshfs:

    - Don't build sshfs Universally (i.e., leave out "-arch ppc").
      It won't work, because the port-installed libraries are i386-only.

    - Run "configure" like this:

          CFLAGS="-D__FreeBSD__=10 -O -g -arch i386 -isysroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk" LDFLAGS="-arch i386" ./configure --prefix=/usr/local --disable-dependency-tracking

    - After running "configure", manually edit Makefile and remove "-pthread"

    http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/FileSystems

    UNINSTALLING MacFUSE:

    From the FAQ (http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/wiki/FAQ):

        Q: How can I uninstall MacFUSE Core?
        A: If you installed "MacFUSE Core.pkg" version 0.1.9 or greater then
           you can use the uninstall script. From a terminal window run the
           following command:

           sudo /System/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh

14. Various Safari hints: See "safari" cheat sheet.

15. To capture audio going to sound driver, use WireTap Pro
    (http://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/wiretap/)

16. Can't connect to Windows share; log says:

    smb_smb_negotiate: server configuration requires packet signing, which
    we dont support

    See item #1 in the Samba cheat sheet.

17. Capturing the screen:

    a) Entire screen: Command-Shift-3
    b) Just a portion: Command-Shift-4, then drag rectangle around area

    Results are written to a PNG file on the Desktop

18. Disabling the Dashboard (from MacOSXHints.com):


        To turn Dashboard off:

            defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES 

        To turn Dashboard on:

            defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean NO 

        You have to restart the Dock after making either change for it to take
        effect:

            killall Dock 

19. Running Apache

    Enable "Personal Web Sharing" in the System Preferences > Sharing
    panel.

    - Personal directory is in ~/Sites
    - DocumentRoot is "/Library/WebServer/Documents"
    - httpd.conf is in /etc/httpd

    NOTE: When you enable personal web sharing, the system creates file
    "/etc/httpd/users/$USER.conf" to contain the Apache <Directory>
    entry for the user's Sites folder. Any changes (e.g., to enable
    symlinking) must be made in there, not in "httpd.conf".

20. When building GNU-based open source, "configure" fails with

        configure fails with 'Can't determine host type'

    Solution: Copy "config.guess" and "config..sub from /usr/share/libtool
    to the current directory (i.e., the directory containing the GNU
    autoconf-generated "configure" script).

21. NetBeans with Java 6: Use these settings, in
    ~/.netbeans/5.5/etc/netbeans.conf

    netbeans_default_options="-J-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -J-Dapple.awt.graphics.UseQuartz=true -J-Xms32m -J-Xmx512m -J-XX:PermSize=32m -J-XX:MaxPermSize=160m -J-Xverify:none -J-Dapple.laf.useScreenMenuBar=true --fontsize 11"

22. Primer on StartupItems:
    http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/mac/2003/10/21/startup.html

23. Hiding users on the login screen:

        sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow \
        HiddenUsersList -array-add account1 account2 account3

    Be sure to type ".../com.apple.loginwindow", NOT
    ".../com.apple.loginwindow.plist". The file name ends in ".plist",
    but the "defaults" utility ignores the extension. (Using the extension
    results in creation of file
    "/Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist.plist", which is no
    help at all.

24. Accessing Apple Bluetooth from Parallels:

    http://www.mattiouz.com/blog/2007/04/13/how-to-use-the-built-in-mac-bluetooth-in-windows-under-parallels/

25. Creating a custom icon for a drive or folder:

    http://macapper.com/2007/04/21/how-to-create-custom-icons-for-your-mac/

26. Color display becomes whiter and more contrasty all of a sudden.

    Not sure of the cause, but I could see it happening on login. By
    completely removing everything from my home directory, and gradually
    adding things back, I tracked it down to something in
    ~/Library/Preferences. More fiddling eventually turned up the culprit.

    $ plutil -convert xml1 -o foo.xml com.apple.universalaccess.plist

    The resulting XML file showed the contrast set to some absurd value.
    I removed that entry from the XML, then ran:

    $ plutil -convert binary1 -o com.apple.universalaccess.plist foo.xml

    and all was well.

    I must have been hitting the "increase Universal Access was enabled in
    the System Preferences panel, and I must have been hitting the hot key
    to increase the contrast. (Most likely, this is because I recently
    installed QuickSilver, and I mapped some hot keys to iTunes functions,
    and the hot keys I chose were identical to the hot keys for Universal
    Access's increase contrast. I'm not sure what was changing that value,
    but I disabled Universal Access in the System Preferences panel. At
    least now, I know what to do if this happens again.

27. Encrypting an area (i.e., not entire home directory).

    a. Use a FUSE-based file system like EncFS, in conjunction with Mac-FUSE.

    b. Use an encrypted Mac disk image. From
       http://www.macworld.com/2007/10/features/lockup_others/index.php

          If your computer were stolen, the thief would be able to read any
          of your files. Requiring a password to log in wouldn’t keep your
          data safe, because someone could use an OS X Install disc to
          reset your password, or remove your hard drive and view the files
          on another computer. Encrypting your most sensitive files is the
          best solution.

          FileVault, introduced in OS X 10.3 (Panther), can do this, but
          encrypting all your data in this way can be dangerous; even a
          minor disk error could leave you unable to access any of your
          files. A better way is to create an encrypted disk image.

          In Disk Utility, create a new disk image (File: New: Blank Disk
          Image). Then, under Encryption, choose AES-128. From the Format
          pop-up menu, choose Sparse Disk Image and specify a name and
          location. When the Authenticate dialog box appears, choose a
          password; clicking on the key button next to the Password text
          box will summon Apple’s Password Assistant, which can help you
          generate a secure one. (See full instructions
          [http://find.macworld.com/2425]; if that seems like too much
          trouble, you can also create an encrypted disk image with a
          third-party product such as PGP Desktop Home [$99].)

          Once you’ve created an encrypted disk image, you can use it to
          store any files containing private data. Just remember that as
          long as the disk image is mounted, your files are vulnerable. So
          be sure to log out (or at least unmount the disk image) whenever
          you step away from your computer.

28. Preventing Mac OS X from creating .DS_Store files over network connections
    http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301711

    Note: This will affect the user's interactions with SMB/CIFS, AFP, NFS,
    and WebDAV servers.

    - Open the Terminal.
    - Type:
      defaults write com.apple.desktopservices DSDontWriteNetworkStores true
    - Press Return.
    - Restart the computer.

    Disabling the creation of .DS_Store files on remote file servers can cause
    unexpected behavior in the Finder. See
    http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=107822

    (Get Info comments aren't properly propagated.)

29. Clear the DNS cache: sudo lookupd -flushcache

30. Change information about a printer: Use
    /Applications/Utilities/Printer Setup Utility

31. Mouse Gestures for Safari:

    http://en.cyan-stivy.net/safari-plugins/safarigestures/

    SIMBL plug-in. Works with Safari 4.

32. Run BIND on Mac OS X:

    http://slaptijack.com/system-administration/bind-startup-in-mac-os-x-104-tiger/
    http://slaptijack.com/system-administration/starting-bind-in-os-x-even-after-reboot/

33. Use DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH to pick up dylib files.

34. LPD printer stopped. No explanation.

    Solution: Check /etc/hosts.lpd on machine running LPD.

34. Change default application that opens a file (e.g., PDF).
    Use the third-party RCDefaultApp preference pane. See
    http://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/

35. Disabling "Empty Trash" confirmation dialog:

    Go to Finder → Preferences, select the Advanced button and uncheck
    “Show warning before emptying the Trash.” You may also wish to check the
    “Empty Trash securely” while you’re there.

36. Running cron:

    http://mactips.dwhoard.com/home/system/schedule-automatic-tasks

    Once the crontab file and the associated script file(s) have been
    created and stored in the specified locations, you must initiate the
    cron process by issuing the command:

        crontab $HOME/.crontab

37. Create a DVD from a VIDEO_TS directory (e.g., as created from iDVD's
    "Save to VIDEO_TS" capability). From
    http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20070612161317338

    Type in this command and change the paths to suit:

        hdiutil makehybrid -udf -udf-volume-name DVD_NAME \
        -o MY_DVD.iso /path/to/VIDEO_TS/parent/folder

    Make sure that /path/to/VIDEO_TS/parent/folder is the path to the folder
    containing the VIDEO_TS folder, not the VIDEO_TS folder itself. Once the
    .iso file has been created, drag this to Disk Utility and hit the Burn
    button.

38. Merge two PDFs, or pages thereof:

    - Open both PDF documents in Preview.
    - Ensure that the sidebar is visible in both. (View > Sidebar > Show...)
    - Drag the pages from the source document to the target document.
    - Rearrange within the sidebar of the target document.
