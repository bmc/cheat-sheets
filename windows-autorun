How to Make a CD-R Automatically Play a Video or Display a web page using
the Autoplay  feature.

(from: http://website.lineone.net/~andy.savage3/tips/#autocd)

If you own a CD writer and would like to burn a CD which when inserted into
a PC will automatically start playing an mpeg video or run html code, Read
on.

If you place a file called autorun.inf in the root of the CD-R then the PC
will run the script in it when it is inserted into a PC's CDROM drive.

To make a mpeg movie play all you need to do is use the Windows START
command to launch the media player with your video.

To do this, Create a notepad document called autorun.inf and put the
following blue text into it, Substituting the name of the video with
yours....

[autorun]
open=C:\windows\command\start.exe AlanPartridgeMockingAlan.mpg

Remember to save the file as autorun.inf

In the above example it will run the mpeg video called
AlanPartridgeMockingAlan.mpg

If you burn a CD-R with this file and your mpeg video in the root of the CD
it will automatically play the video when inserted. This method can also be
used to auto run an HTML page you have on your CD, This means that you can
create a nice front end menu system for the CD. This is ideal if you want
to create an interactive photo album forsomeone. You can make it launch
your index.html page which will could have thumbnails links to your
photographs on it, you could combine this with the Kiosk mode option of IE5

This will work on all Windows 95/98/ME machines where windows has been
installed to the standard directory of "C:\Windows"

Please note that this does not work on NT machines because Windows is not
installed in the Windows directory.
