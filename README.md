# Various Cheat Sheets

This repository contains a set of cheat sheets on various topics. The cheat
sheets are maintained as Markdown documents, as supported by the Ruby
Kramdown gem. The documents are converted to HTML via Jekyll, and are
available [here](http://software.clapper.org/cheat-sheets/). The Markdown cheat
sheet files are on the [gh-pages](https://github.com/bmc/cheat-sheets/tree/gh-pages) branch of this repository.
