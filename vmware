VMWare 5:

1. Linkage error bringing up vmware:

   $ vmware
   /usr/lib/vmware/bin/vmware: relocation error: /usr/lib/vmware/lib/libgtkmm-2.4.so.1/libgtkmm-2.4.so.1: undefined symbol: gtk_action_get_type

   Solution: Use the gtk library shipped with VMWare. Simplest solution is
   to hack /usr/lib/vmware/lib/wrapper-gtk24.sh with the patch in the
   "vmware.patch" file (in this directory).


2. Installing on FC6: See "fedora" cheat sheet, #40.
