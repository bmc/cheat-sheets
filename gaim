1. Tabbed windows won't go away, even if "Show IMs and chats in tabbed windows"
   is unchecked in Preferences>Conversations.

   - From the GAIM bug list: Problem is, the "Placement" option (in
     "Conversations", right above the "Tab Options" on the same preferences
     page) overrides the tab setting. If "Placement" is set to "last
     created window", then tabbing is still enabled. Set to "New window".

   - To re-enabled tabbing, both much be changed:

     Tab Options>Show IMs... must be checked
     Conversations>Placement must be set to "Last created window"

   This behavior was verified against GAIM 0.68 and GAIM 0.69. Relevant
   bug entries are (among others):

2. Getting gaim to use the network audio system (NAS).

   a. Install libao and libao-devel. With "rpm -q --list libao", determine
      whether libnas.so is in the plugins directory. If so, skip to (c).
   b. If not, build libao from source RPM. Might have to edit libao.spec so
      that "--enable-nas" is specified on the "configure" command line.
      Install both libao and libao-devel.
   c. Add the following line to either /etc/libao.conf or ~/.libao
	default_driver=nas
   d. In Gaim's Sound preferences tab, select NAS as the audio method.

FreeBSD compilation problems with gaim:

1. Edit "autogen.sh" and
   a) change "./configure" to "bash ./configure"
   b) change "libtoolize" to "libtoolize15"
2. Run "bash autogen.sh"
3. Edit "configure", and remove "--no-verify" from invocation of ltconfig
4. Run "bash configure" (not "sh configure")
