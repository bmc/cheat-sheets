1. Useful cheat sheet here:

2. Getting rid of this warning:

   warning: You did not specify any refspecs to push, and the current remote
   warning: has not configured any push refspecs. The default action in this
   warning: case is to push all matching refspecs, that is, all branches
   warning: that exist both locally and remotely will be updated.  This may
   warning: not necessarily be what you want to happen.
   warning: 
   warning: You can specify what action you want to take in this case, and
   warning: avoid seeing this message again, by configuring 'push.default' to:
   warning:   'nothing'  : Do not push anything
   warning:   'matching' : Push all matching branches (default)
   warning:   'tracking' : Push the current branch to whatever it is tracking
   warning:   'current'  : Push the current branch


   $ git config push.default matching
   $ git config --global push.default matching

3. Delete a remote branch:

   $ git push REMOTENAME :BRANCHNAME

   If you look at the advanced push syntax above it should make a bit more
   sense. You are literally telling git “push nothing into BRANCHNAME on
   REMOTENAME”.

4. Create a bare repository:

   a) Fresh:

      $ mkdir foo.git && cd foo.git
      $ git --bare init

   b) From an existing repo:

      $ git clone --bare /path/to/existing/repo proj.git

5. To mark a conflicted file resolved: "git add file"
